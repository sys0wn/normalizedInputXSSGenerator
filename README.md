# normalizedInputXSSGenerator

Kinda stolen from a CTF writeup and might be useful if a xss payload is normalized at some point this can be used to bypass other defenses based on unicode confusibles.

The output created by this tool are unicode confusibles, that look different, but are often interpreted as normal by browsers and stuff!
